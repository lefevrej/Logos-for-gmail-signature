# Logo library for gmail signature

Want to add a logo in your gmail signature but can't import an image from your computer? The only way is to add an image by its URL. 
This repository is therefore created to provide the logos you want in a perfect size for a gmail signature.

You will find these logos in the [`/icons`](https://github.com/lefevrej/icons/icons) directory.
